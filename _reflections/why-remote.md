A quick summary. Feel free to ask for details if you want, as it is difficult to offend or annoy me.

#### The situation.

The woman I love is absolutely set on living in the countryside. Fine by me.

#### The only problem?

Programming work is generally done in cities. A long daily commute flies in the face of my desire for efficiency. (A rare journey is exciting and thus valuable, whereas a common, repetitive journey is not.)

#### Remote work is the perfect solution.

I practically live on the Internet as it is, since my best friends live all across the United States and Western Europe. Working over the Internet will be no problem, since the industry already knows that the collaboration tools satisfy their role.

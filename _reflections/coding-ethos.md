The quality of my code matters to me, for better or worse. Sometimes I spend too much time polishing my work when I should be creating something new. But oddly enough, I have no qualms about deleting or completely replacing my obsolete code, no matter how much effort I put into it before.

Clean code is a top priority. Clean code, if broken, should be easy to fix. Sloppy code, if it works, will eventually break and need to be fixed.

In rare cases where there's no way to make the code both sufficient and clean, sufficient code takes priority, and comments are a necessary replacement for cleanliness.

If the code is clean, I generally consider comments unnecessary. I prefer descriptive naming and consistent code structure.

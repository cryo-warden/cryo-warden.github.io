This is a list of my noteworthy strengths and flaws, relative to how I perceive most other people.

----

#### Strength #1: Rational self-reflection.

My options undergo high scrutiny before I enact any of them. This process is well practiced and completes quickly. Outside of a deliberate brainstorming session, it is unusual for anything I say to be incorrect. Expect to hear, "I don't know yet," where appropriate.

I believe every person has flaws, and every action has flaws. Rationality demands that we acknowledge these flaws and plan accordingly.

----

#### Weakness #1: Low self-confidence.

This is the drawback to thorough self-inspection. No action I take is unilateral. Every action has drawbacks, and these drawbacks will always be apparent to a sufficiently honest person.

There is usually one best action to take, but it will still have drawbacks, even if it is obviously the best choice.

> The obvious correct answer (in most situations) is to breathe. Breathing is generally necessary for survival. However, this has a non-zero probability of harming you via accidental inhalation of harmful chemicals or foreign objects.

There are drawbacks, and I acknowledge them, but still I advocate breathing. This is the essence of true rationality. The unfortunate consequence is that my confidence levels are not allowed to be unrealistically high, the way humans expect to see them.

#### Strength #2: Strong belief in security and trust. Will keep secrets for you. Will not lie to you.

I am publicly listing my greatest personality flaws, which should be considered strong evidence of honesty. However, it should also be considered weak evidence that I cannot keep secrets. In spite of this evidence, I claim that I always keep secrets when I choose to. I shall provide supporting claims.

* I never share passwords.
* I can GM an online game of Mafia without slipping evidence to the players.

Keeping secrets is an important facet of trust, of course. In essence, I keep secrets for the same reason I do not tell lies.

#### Weakness #2: Strong belief in security and trust. Will not lie for you. Will keep secrets from you.

Trust and fairness mean a lot to me. I will uphold my ethical code for your good, so you should expect that I will uphold it for the good of others as well.

Any secrets kept from you will be harmless and will simply not matter to you anyway.

Strong intuition.

Weird.

Calm and kind.

Competitive.

Not easily intimidated, even when I should be. I could have a casual conversation with a celebrity.

Not subservient. My actions require a specific known purpose. Demands for blind obedience will harm my motivation. There's an easy workaround for this. Simply request obedience now and a promise an explanation later. My nature drives me to act as a partner to anyone whose goals align with my own. If I have reason to trust your judgment, then I will.

Happy to take the lead. When I understand a group's goals and those goals align with my own, then I naturally take initiative when someone needs to. I consciously override the [bystander effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect).

Capable of abnormal specificity.

Sometimes goes into too much detail.

Never gets offended.

Goes off on tangents. (The tangents are usually interesting.)

----

#### Weakness #X: Excessive curiosity.

Without external influence, I spend more time studying than I spend creating.

----

#### Strength #X: Excellent use of language.

I avoid using big words because I would rather communicate than signal high status.

----

#### Weakness #X: Colorblindness.

I am slightly colorblind. Green and orange actually look alike to my eyes. While I feel like this shouldn't matter, it nevertheless makes itself relevant in my every creative endeavor.

----

#### Weakness #X: Perfectionism.

I am much too afraid to show my work before spending an unrealistic amount of time polishing it. Since this is impractical, I am trying various plans to correct this behavior. For instance, I am going to publish this page even though this sentence is not

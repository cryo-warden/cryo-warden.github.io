Welcome to the standard About page.

The following questions focus on this website. If you wanted to see anything that would go on an About Me page, the rest of the site is meant to do that.

----

#### What is the purpose of this site?

Currently, this site exists to inform people about me. Target audience: prospective employers.

This website is:

* more efficient than conversation and
* more appealing than a bloated resume.

----

#### What tools are used for this site?

Aside from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), git, GitHub Pages, HTML, SASS, Liquid, and JavaScript?

The editor used is Visual Studio Code. This lightweight editor is wonderful. I dread the day when feature-bloat ruins its core value.

The HTML output is compressed using [jekyll-compress-html](https://github.com/penibelst/jekyll-compress-html).

----

#### What's the point of working so hard on this site? Won't it be useless when you're done job-hunting?

It should still have sufficient value. If I use it correctly, this site would be a great way for all kinds of people to get to know me.

#### What's with the name "cryo warden"?

"cryo warden" is an anagram of my first name and middle name, *and* it's an anagram of my first name followed by an anagram of my middle name. There are some other nice anagrams in the first category — such as "wordy crane", "one wry card", and "wary nerd co" — but I don't know any other good anagrams in the latter category.

----

#### Okay, so why is "cryo warden" in all lowercase?

Capital letters have their place in decoration, but I personally embrace the aesthetic of lowercase. Embracing my preferences publicly should increase my probability of associating with people who share my preferences.

----

#### Are there any photos of you on here?

There are not.

#### Why not?

The simple answer is that I do not believe such photos have value.

The complete answer is more philosophical. Forgive me if you've heard all this before.

Before we can answer "Are there any photos of you?" we must first define "you".

It is typical to define a person as their entire body: face and build and brain and personality etc. However, a simple thought experiment debunks this idea, at least in my case:

> ###### Thought Experiment
>
> Suppose you woke up tomorrow and found that your mind inhabited a different body, with a different face, nothing like what you currently have. You would be different, but would you be a different person?
>
> In my case, I firmly believe I would be the same person. I would have a different body, but this would not affect my personal identity.

I prefer to define my "self" as a specific set of memories and patterns of thought. (In fairness, I cannot truly define this set, but if I did have a complete definition for "self", I believe it would take that form.)

And for now, let's mention but not explore two relevant tangents:

* Memories and patterns of thought *do* change over time, so this definition of identity would make you a different person pretty much all the time. (This is easy to fix.)
* Defining the mind-body interface is vague at best. (This is not easy to fix, but theoretically tractable.)

So many of my best memories of living in Indianapolis are tied up in [Super Smash Bros. tournaments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFiT_SD2uwc).

I get along well with people who defeat me. Likewise with the people I tend to defeat. And most of the Smash players seems to be the same. Thus, it has always been a fantastic way to make friends. (And being recognized as one of the top players in your city is nice too.)

Of course, while the friendship is valuable, the main thing that gets recorded is the competition. Fair enough. Those records add weight to the tournament. They're yet another factor meant to make us care more, to increase our intensity.

Looking back on my old games — even those I've won — so many squandered advantages abound. From my current perspective, they're obvious to me. So fixated on the technical game, I seldom modelled my opponents thoughts. The true game is the battle of predictions, underlying all the fancy tricks. Predict your opponent's thoughts, and victory will come. I so rarely took full advantage of that true game.

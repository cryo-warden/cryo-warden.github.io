[Magic: The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules) is an interesting case. I love it, and I hate it.

**The rules are so beautiful.**

*The resource system can fall out from under you.*

**Deck-creation is expressive and exciting.**

*Sorting and searching physical cards is a pain.*

**Tournaments are a fantastic way to make friends.**

*Tournaments are rife with cheating, and powerful cards are too expensive anyway.*

**The mind games are brilliant!**

*The strongest decks win as fast as possible, before the most interesting decks do any interesting things.*

I don't think I'll ever stop playing.

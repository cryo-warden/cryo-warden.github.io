[The game of Mafia](https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Game_of_Mafia) is only slightly older than I am.

I run/play sessions online. It must be noted that the online version does conceal many signals that are vital in the face-to-face version:

* body language
* facial expressions
* tone

Nonetheless, a different kind of fun is plentiful in analyzing people's written argumentation to find the liars.

But more than anything else about the game, I enjoy creating setups that are both easy-to-understand and mind-blowing to play.

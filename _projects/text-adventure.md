For fun and to learn about machine creativity, I'm making a [text-based adventure game](https://funwithbrains.github.io/text-adventure/). The current plan is to make the game single-player and fully client-side.

That said, I'll keep the potential for multiplayer in the back of my mind. Then the code should be easier to extend later.

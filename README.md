A text RPG playable entirely via point and click.

I have opted to construct this app by combining a stateless React system with a stateful game engine. This allows the use of standard game engine patterns alongside standard React patterns.

The stateful engine section can be seen as a separate server-like system in relation to a more normal React frontend. In fact, if I decide to invest money into servers, I may create a multiplayer version by taking advantage of this separation.
